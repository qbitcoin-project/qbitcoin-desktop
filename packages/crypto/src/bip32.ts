// BIP-32 hierarchical deterministic key derivation for secp256k1.
//
// Thin wrapper over @scure/bip32, plus the chain-specific derivation
// scheme registry.
//
// BRAND FILE: the derivation scheme (coin_type, scheme id) is a brand
// value — brand branches edit it in place. Scheme `id`s are persisted in
// wallet storage, so a brand must never change its id once shipped.
//
// Why a registry instead of a single hardcoded path: schemes can change
// over a chain's lifetime (QBitcoin derived from a placeholder before
// its SLIP-0044 number 2009 landed). A shipped scheme never leaves the
// registry — it flips to 'legacy' and a new active one is added.
//
// The Falcon-512 PQ branch derives BIP-32 leaves under purpose 512'
// (same coin_type, fully hardened) and stretches them into Falcon
// keygen seeds via HKDF — see `falconHd.ts`.
